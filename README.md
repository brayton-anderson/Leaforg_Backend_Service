## Solution Details

The [Call for Code 2021](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/) Global Challenge asked teams of developers, designers, data scientists and business analysts to build solutions that significantly improve preparedness for natural disasters and accelerate relief when they hit. We answered the call and we have developed a solution that aims to raise environmental awareness by positively change people’s behavior to recycle more.

## 1.Find a recycler: 
We will help recycling businesses get noticed by adding their contact details to be accessible to users interested in getting rid of products in an environmentally friendly way>through an interactive map. Users can simply insert their addresses and a list of registered and authenticated recyclers gets displayed for users to pick the closest and most convenient option. Recyclers and users can then agree on a pickup time and a place.Though this feature is not ready yet, it is one of the many visions we have for the future.

## 2.Marketplace: 
Users who have products they’d like to resell to others interested can post their items for sale on the Leaforg marketplace.This marketplace will be split into two main categories.The biodegradable and non-biodegradable products.This way, users can earn money by selling their items and stay environmentally friendly. Buyers and sellers can perform transactions smoothly and securely on the Leaforg platform.There will be a search bar for buyers to look up the items they’d like to buy, sellers will have a ranking system with reviews. Buyers can be sure that their payment is secured through an escrow account run by Leaforg to guarantee safety for all parties involved.


Buyers can look up the items they want in the search bar, find the right seller,filter by price, location, and many other categories to find the product they want,then compare sellers and read reviews of previous buyers.

## 3.Recycle at home
(Tips for end-users on how to recycle products at home).This section will be a place where users go to share their ideas and experiences on the recycling process(Best Practices). The concept is similar to social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok but it will mainly focus on recycling, users will view videos of creators who recycle products at home and creators will get paid per view and for every user who follows in their steps and uses their video to recycle something at home.This category is what sets us apart from the competition as everything mentioned before already exists,this idea is original and innovative.We will not focus on one market but the entire world.We are counting on the fact that people love to watch small videos and do challenges, why not use this desire for something useful? And this is what makes Leaforg different.

#### Leaforg App

Leaforg App is designed and developed for people with a recycing mind, to sell, buy and share recycling ideas in their current location. The app lists user products and posts for viewing and purchase, The app will fetch these information from a Backend service hosted on IBM as a micro service.

#### IBM Cloud Backend Micro Service

## Project Roadmap

The Leaforg solution currently comprises mainly highly visual and easy-to-use web application, a back-end API service to power the app, and the IBM Watson Assistant to communicate and direct users to the right product, and offer support. Our future roadmap adds more functionality to the Leaforg platform by: 

1. Introducing both mobile and desktop application,
2. Implementing the Recyclers feature
3. Building a backend API using python.
4. Implementing messaging feature.
5. Strengthen Security

The goal of the project is to help more persons become enviromentally friendly by providing them with easy yo use platform that introduces them to quick and simple ways to recycle their products, whether it is through the recycle at home feature to repair them, dispose them responsibly through the find a recycler feature, or selling them to others through our marketplace feature.

Participation is welcomed from software developers, designers, testers, disposal experts, stores, repair shops, green products manufactures, and others that can help improve the our environments by coming with solutions to reduce our carbon footprints around the world. 

Key areas the team are interested in developing include localizing the mobile app, improving the backend api service, updating project documentation, software, more in-depth research, and adding products data to the database.
